# CoinWatch
**CoinWatch** is a cryptocurrency app that displays data about current coin prices and market details.

The app is built using the latest [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations) - resulting in a scalable, modularised and testable app.

# Built With üõ† 
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Retrofit
- Coil
- OkHttp
- Coroutines
- Flow
- Hilt
- ViewModel
- Timber logging
- Room
- Material Design 3
- Static code analysis using Ktlint

# Architecture üß±
The design of CoinWatch follows a few key principles:
1. Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) - state flows in one direction, events that modify the data flow in the opposite direction
2. Single Source of Truth (SSOT) - the SSOT is the owner of data, and only the SSOT can modify or mutate it
3. Drive UI from immutable data models - app data is contained within persistent data models and drives UI components

A high-level overview of the app's architecture is displayed below.
